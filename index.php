    Sport is an amazing concept that improves the lives of people. 
    Students especially need to take part in sports that they find fun because participating in sports will not only help them to improve their physical health but will also give them the mental energy to cope and study well.
    By playing sports, students release serotonin and other chemicals in the brain and because of this exertion, they will feel more rejuvenated every day. It will help them to stay fit and to have a healthy and positive life. 
    Sports also play a very important role in having stable and healthy mental health.
